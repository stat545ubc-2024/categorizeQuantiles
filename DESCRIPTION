Description: The goal of categorizeQuantiles is to provide tools for categorizing numeric variables in data frames or tibbles into quantile-based categories. 
             This is especially useful for grouping continuous data into discrete categories based on quantiles, making it easier to analyze and visualize patterns within categorical groups.
